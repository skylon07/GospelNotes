The Gospel-oriented Note Journal!

### What is it?

Gospel Notes is a small study-journalling app, intended to be used alongside Gospel Library. If you love the content that Gospel Library offers, but want more flexibility managing your scriptural notes, then Gospel Notes is the perfect fit for you!

### What can it do?

Gospel Notes has a few key features:

- Nameable pages, where you can organize notes into categories such as doctrinal questions (and common counter-questions), scriptural lessons, or topical notes for general gospel discussions
- Fluid UI and easy-to-navigate notebook system
- Integrated search engine with options including searching folders, notebooks, and individual notes
- "Deep Link" generators (to link notes to resources in Gospel Library; one click away!)
- The ability to backup and share notebooks with other Gospel Notes users

### How do I use it?

Easy! Go to **[WEBSITE HERE]** to use online, or you can download a copy of the program for offline use.

### Frequently Asked Questions

- Can I use it even if I am not a member of your church?
